# 👋 Hi, I’m Justin  

I’m a **software developer and digital humanist** with an interdisciplinary background — I first completed a **Master’s in English Literature**, then made the leap into **Computer Science** through UBC’s BCS Second Degree program. I bring storytelling, empathy, and design thinking into my technical work, building tools that are not only functional but also meaningful and accessible.
